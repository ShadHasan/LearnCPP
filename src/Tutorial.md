## Struct, Namespace and class

- strictly speaking, they're exactly the same except classes default to private, whereas structs default to public.
- Aesthetically speaking, structs are generally used for just groupings of information (data structures), whereas classes are used to represent objects.
- In practice, the two are used in different styles. Generally structs have public members and are just clumps of data.
Whereas classes tend to be encapsulated objects.
This is not a "rule", though. It's just a style thing for clarity.
